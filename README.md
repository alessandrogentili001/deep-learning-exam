# Satellite Image Segmentation - Deep Learning Exam

## University of Bologna
### Course: Deep Learning
### Professor: Andrea Asperti

## Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for the deep learning exam at the University of Bologna. The main component is a Python notebook that implements a solution to a satellite image segmentation problem.

## Project Structure

- `satellite_segmentation_exam.ipynb`: noteboook containing the assignment and the link for teh dataset download.
- `solution`: notebook containing my personal solution to the problem.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alessandrogentili001/DeepLearning-exam.git
   cd DeepLearning-exam
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook solution.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code and generate results.

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for satellite image segmentation. The main objectives include:

- Preprocessing satellite imagery data
- Implementing a suitable deep learning architecture for segmentation
- Training and evaluating the model using the given metric
- Visualizing and analyzing results

## Evaluation Criteria

The exam will be evaluated based on:

- Correctness of implementation
- Model performance and accuracy
- Code quality and documentation
- Analysis and interpretation of results
